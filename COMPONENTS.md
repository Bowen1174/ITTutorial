__First thing first, pick a CPU then pick a motherboard then pick everything else that is compatible with your CPU and motherboard.__

The Components:
1. The CPU - the brain of the computer
2. The CPU cooler - there are two kinds: air coolers and liquid cooler. Air Coolers keep the heat away from the CPU and then blows the heat out with a fan out of the way of the CPU. Now there are different types of liquid cooling, but the best one to start with would be a all in one. A all in one comes with a CPU block and a radiator. The CPU block connects to the CPU and water is pumped into tiny channels of the CPU block and absorbs the heat from the CPU then that water travels to the radiator which cools the water down with its fans and just keeps doing that.
3. The Motherboard - the motherboard is what everything connects to and it allows all the parts to connect to one another so everything works together.
4. Memory sticks (RAM) - this is your computers internal memory while your computer is powered on.
5. Graphics Card - this is what is responsible for rendering images on your monitor. The better your graphics card, the better your graphics will be for your games. 
6. Storage Drives - For this you have two options: a Solid State Drive (SSD) or a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). SSDs are much faster than the HDD. HDDS are much larger and much slower. Depending on your motherboard you could have multiple storage drives and the more the better. 
7. The Power Supply - this is what gives your computer the power it needs to run all of your components. 
8. The Case - this is where all your components will be held. Make sure case can fit your motherboard and all the components you have chosen.
