# My IT Tutorial
## How to build a Gaming PC | By Austin Bowen
### Reason of my Tutorial:
I created this tutorial because a lot people either don't know how or are scared of building a PC because they are afraid of damaging it. I am going to show you what you need to make it and how you can make it. I will do a specific one, but you can always change things to whatever you like more. This will be more of a beginner guide on how to build a PC. 

If you click [HERE](COMPONENTS.md) you can see all the components you will need in building your PC. There are lots of different components so make sure you pick what you want and make sure everything will work together. Also you don't have to pay 1000s of dollars to build the PC you want. You can always start of small and work your way up to the more expensive pieces.
