# My IT Tutorial
## How to build a Gaming PC | By Austin Bowen
### Reason of my Tutorial:
I created this tutorial because a lot people either don't know how or are scared of building a PC because they are afraid of damaging it. I am going to show you what you need to make it and how you can make it. I will do a specific one, but you can always change things to whatever you like more. This will be more of a beginner guide on how to build a PC. 

__The Components:__

If you click [HERE](COMPONENTS.md) you can see all the components you will need in building your PC. There are lots of different components so make sure you pick what you want and make sure everything will work together. Also you don't have to pay 1000s of dollars to build the PC you want. You can always start of small and work your way up to the more expensive pieces.

__The Build:__

For your build you will only need a couple tools to assemble your PC.

1. You need a Phillips head screw driver
2. I would recommend some zip ties for your cable, so you can make them looks nice and not have them going everywhere.
3. Another tool you could use is some pliers. These could be used to cut your zip ties and could be helpful if you need to pick something little up that is hard to grab.
