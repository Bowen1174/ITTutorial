## Step 1
- Rest your motherboard on top of its box and get ready to install the CPU
## Step 2
- Installing the CPU will depend on what motherboard and CPU you have, but you will most likely have to unscrew some screws and place the CPU in its place then screw it in. Be careful when placing the CPU to not bend the tiny spokes. Also hold the CPU by the four sides and not its back or front to keep the grease from your fingers off of it. If you do end up bending one of the spokes its okay just try and bend it back gently and see if it will still work. 
## Step 3
- Placing your RAM. Your RAM will stick into the motherboard. There will be long thin slots that they will fit into. Your motherboard manual will show you where to put the sticks of RAM at and yes it does matter which slot they go in. There is only one way of putting RAM in. All you have to do is put it in the slot and push down on it with a little pressure till it clicks into place.
## Step 4
- After you place your RAM you should start getting your CPU cooling things together. What I mean by that is get all the screws screwed into the cooler you are using and get it ready for screwing into the motherboard later on.
## Step 5
- Installing the motherboard: Before you start screwing the motherboard down make sure you don't have to screw any screw stand offs down so your motherboard fits. Some cases have this some do not. Next install the back plate that came with the motherboard on the outside of the case for all the outside plugs to the motherboard. Then gently place the motherboard in the case on top of the screw posts or screw stand offs. Then screw in all the screws, but don't tighten too tight just tighten enough so the mother board will not jiggle around.
## Step 6
- The next steps you can really do in any order because everything now just has to be plugged in, but one of the first things you want to get out of the way is the power supply because those cords are big and can get in the way. There is only one way to plug the power supply into the motherboard so just plug it in where ever it fits.
## Step 7
- Now you can install you CPU fans. Most fans are the same, but just follow the install manual you got from it and it should screw in nicely and then just plug it into the CPU fan plug on the motherboard. Make sure if you are using liquid cooling to not plug the cord into the CPU fan cooler and to plug it in the other one. The manual for the motherboard will explain that. They also only have one way to fit so you shouldn't mix them up.
## Step 8
- The next thing to install before things get cluttered is the front panel stuff. This can be the power button, reset button, lights, audio jacks, USBs and things like that. They are very small and they plug into the motherboard. This is where the pliers are handy if you have bigger hands. You can also install the case fans at this point as well
## Step 9
- Next step is to install your SSDs and/or your HDDs. Hook your mounts up to them and install them on the case. There are multiple mounts so just screw them in whatever you like best. Then plug the power and SATA cables into them. Then plug the drives into the motherboard.
## Step 10
- You're almost done and now you have to install the graphics cad. Its almost like the RAM install, but is bigger and has to be lined up a little better when putting it in the slot on the motherboard. Make sure you plug in the power supply to the graphics card if needed. Some do not need it.
## Step 11
- Now you are done with your build unless you want to add lights or accessories. One thing you should do though is use those zip ties and make your cables a little less messy. It will just make things look neat and nice, especially if you have a open case. Then you can put the rest of the case together and plug your keyboard, mouse and monitor or monitors into it and turn it on! If it does not turn on make sure you have turned on the power switch and then just recheck all of your cables. Make sure they are in the right spots.
