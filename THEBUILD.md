## Step 1
- Rest your motherboard on top of its box and get ready to install the CPU
## Step 2
- Installing the CPU will depend on what motherboard and CPU you have, but you will most likely have to unscrew some screws and place the CPU in its place then screw it in. Be careful when placing the CPU to not bend the tiny spokes. Also hold the CPU by the four sides and not its back or front to keep the grease from your fingers off of it. If you do end up bending one of the spokes its okay just try and bend it back gently and see if it will still work. 
## Step 3
- Placing your RAM. Your RAM will stick into the motherboard. There will be long thin slots that they will fit into. Your motherboard manual will show you where to put the sticks of RAM at and yes it does matter which slow they go in. There is only one way of putting RAM in. All you have to do is put it in the slot and push down on it with a little pressure till it clicks into place.
